## Abnormal Heartbeat Detection with LSTMs and CNNs

**Description:** This project involved training a deep learning model to perform binary classification on heartbeats (normal vs abnormal) using electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The primary tools used were Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### Implementation (see notebook for each task):
* Data was first visualized and processed, including loading ECG files.
* Feature extraction was performed using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
* A Bidirectional LSTM was used for classification, and the model was evaluated by calculating accuracy.
* Deep CNNs were also explored for classification tasks.
